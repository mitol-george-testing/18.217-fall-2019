**Description:** This lecture concludes the proof of Freiman’s theorem on sets of small doubling. Professor Zhao also discusses additional topics related to Freiman’s theorem, including extensions to groups (abelian and nonabelian), and the polynomial Freiman–Ruzsa conjecture, which is a central open problem in additive combinatorics.

**Instructor:** Yufei Zhao
