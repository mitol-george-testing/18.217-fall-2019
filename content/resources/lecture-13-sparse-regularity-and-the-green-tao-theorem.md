**Description:** After a brief discussion of Ramanujan graphs, Professor Zhao discusses one of his favorite topics (also the subject of his own PhD dissertation): the regularity method for sparse graphs and its application to the celebrated Greenâ€“Tao theorem that the primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.

**Instructor:** Yufei Zhao
