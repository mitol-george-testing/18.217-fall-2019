**Description:** Pseudorandom graphs are graphs that behave like random graphs in certain prescribed ways. In this lecture, Professor Zhao discusses a classic result of Chung, Graham, and Wilson, which shows that many definitions of quasirandom graphs are surprisingly equivalent. This result highlights the role of 4-cycles in pseudorandomness. The expander mixing lemma is also discussed near the end of the lecture.

**Instructor:** Yufei Zhao
