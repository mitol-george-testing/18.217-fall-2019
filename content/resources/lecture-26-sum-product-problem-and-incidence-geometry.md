**Description:** A famous open problem says that no set of integers can simultaneously have a small sum set A+A and a small product set AA. In the final lecture of this course, Professor Zhao explains two bounds, with the first using tools from graph theory and incidence geometry, and the second using multiplicative energy.

**Instructor:** Yufei Zhao
