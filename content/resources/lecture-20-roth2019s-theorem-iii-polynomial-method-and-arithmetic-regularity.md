**Description:** The first half of the lecture covers a surprising recent breakthrough that gave a short polynomial method proof of Roth’s theorem in the finite field setting, substantially improving previously known bounds on the problem.

The second half explains another proof of Roth’s theorem via the arithmetic regularity method, with consequences for popular differences.

**Instructor:** Yufei Zhao
