**Description:** Which triangle-free graph has the maximum number of edges given the number of vertices? Professor Zhao shows the class Mantel’s theorem, which says that the answer is a complete bipartite graph. He also discusses generalizations: Turán’s theorem (for cliques) and the Erdős–Stone–Simonovits theorem (for general subgraphs).

**Instructor:** Yufei Zhao
